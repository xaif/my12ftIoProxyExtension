# 12ft.io Proxy Helper Chrome Extension

This extension allows you to quickly bypass article paywalls using the 12ft.io proxy with just a single click.

## Installation Guide

Since this extension is not available on the Chrome Web Store, it needs to be manually loaded into Chrome. Here's how you can do that:

1. **Download the extension files.** Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it on your computer.

2. **Open Google Chrome.** Open a new Chrome window.

3. **Navigate to the extensions page.** You can do this by typing `chrome://extensions` into the address bar and pressing Enter.

4. **Enable Developer Mode.** Find the "Developer mode" toggle in the top-right corner of the extensions page and make sure it is turned on.

5. **Load the extension.** Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top-left corner of the page. A file dialog will openâ€”navigate to the directory where you extracted the extension files, select it, and click "Open".

The extension should now be installed and ready to use! You should see its icon in the extensions area of the toolbar. If you don't see it, you may need to pin it: click on the Extensions button (it looks like a puzzle piece) in the toolbar, find the "12ft.io Proxy Helper" extension in the menu, and click the pin icon next to it.

## Usage

To use the extension, navigate to any article or page you'd like to read. Click on the extension's icon in the toolbar to open the current page through the 12ft.io proxy in a new tab. You should now be able to access the content without any paywalls or subscription prompts.
